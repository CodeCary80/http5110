## Code Sample

### The CLI
Using the Command Line Interface (CLI) is a skill you will need to acquire.
Professional Web developers use the CLI on a regular basis: it is easy to use,
efficient, and allows you to do many things at once. It is also a status thing:
not using a GUI has more status that using one. All the images you see of
hackers interacting with keyboard and a screen are using the CLI.
